# Text-to-Speech Converter

This project is a **Text-to-Speech Converter** application that allows users to input text, customize voice options (such as speed and volume), and download the generated speech as an MP3 file. It uses **Amazon Polly** for speech synthesis and is hosted on an **AWS EC2 Windows instance** for public accessibility.

## Features

- Convert text to speech with customizable options:
  - **Voice**: Select from multiple voices (e.g., Joanna, Matthew, Amy).
  - **Speed**: Adjust the speed of the speech (e.g., Slow, Medium, Fast).
  - **Volume**: Adjust the speech volume using a slider.
- Download the generated MP3 file.
- Simple and interactive user interface.
- Hosted on a public IP address generated by an AWS EC2 instance.

## How It Works

1. **Backend**: 
   - Developed using **Flask**.
   - Uses **Amazon Polly** to generate speech from text.
   - Exposes an API `/convert` to handle text-to-speech conversion requests.

2. **Frontend**:
   - A clean, responsive **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** interface.
   - Allows users to input text, select voice and speed, adjust volume, and download the audio output.

3. **Hosting**:
   - Deployed on an **AWS EC2 Windows instance**.
   - The Flask app is run on a publicly accessible IP address generated by the instance.

## AWS EC2 Setup

1. **Instance Launch**:
   - Created a Windows EC2 instance with 1 GB RAM.
   - Configured the necessary security groups to allow HTTP and TCP traffic on port `8000`.

2. **Application Deployment**:
   - Installed Python and required libraries (`Flask`, `boto3`, etc.) on the EC2 instance.
   - Uploaded the project files to the instance.
   - Ran the Flask app on port `8000`, accessible publicly via the EC2 public IP.

3. **Public Access**:
   - The app can be accessed using the EC2 instance's **public IP address**:  
     `http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:8000`
